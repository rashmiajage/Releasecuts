🛠️ ASK PPT: Agent Development Kit (ADK)


---

🎯 Slide 1: Title Slide

Title:

> Agent Development Kit (ADK)
Accelerating DevOps with Autonomous AI Agents



Presented by: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]


---

🧠 Slide 2: The Problem

> Building reliable and observable AI agents is hard.



Agent workflows are fragmented across tools like Jenkins, Splunk, and Jira

Developers struggle with:

Slow prototyping

Poor observability

Lack of tool integration

Limited testing frameworks for agents



Result: Agents are hard to debug, test, and trust in real DevOps environments.


---

🎯 Slide 3: Our Solution — ADK

> A modular toolkit to build, run, test, and observe AI agents



Key Capabilities:

🔌 Plug-and-play tools (Jenkins, Splunk, Jira)

🧠 LLM-powered decision-making

🧪 Testable agent workflows

📊 Full observability (actions, retries, logs)



---

🧰 Slide 4: Tool Integrations

Tool	Capabilities

Jenkins	Trigger jobs, poll build status, fetch logs
Splunk	Search logs with natural language or SPL
Jira	Create, update, and query issues


All tools are accessible via LangChain, OpenAI Functions, or custom loops.


---

💻 Slide 5: Streamlit UI Demo

> Live agent interface for DevOps automation



Features:

Natural language input

Build trigger + live Jenkins status with progress bar

Splunk log search results

Jira issue creation (on failure)


📸 (Include screenshots or a short GIF demo here)


---

🧪 Slide 6: Evaluation & Observability

> Agents need to be testable and observable



✅ Integrated with DeepEval for regression testing

🧠 Tracks:

Tool inputs/outputs

Function call chains

Agent thoughts/retries/errors




---

📦 Slide 7: Use Cases

Role	Use Case

DevOps Engineer	“Trigger a build, check Splunk logs, and create Jira issue on failure”
SRE	“Search for incidents and correlate with CI/CD failures”
QA	“Run test automation agents with build and defect tracking”



---

📈 Slide 8: Impact

> Why ADK matters



⚡ Faster prototyping of AI agents

✅ More reliable and testable agents

🔍 Improved observability and trust in automation

💡 Enables domain-specific copilots for DevOps and operations



---

🤝 Slide 9: The Ask

> What we need to move forward:



Item	Why

✅ Sponsor for a pilot project	Apply ADK to a real CI/CD pipeline
💻 Infra access (Jenkins, Splunk, Jira sandbox)	For testing and demos
👥 1–2 Developers for 2 weeks	Build reusable agents and workflows
📢 Internal visibility	Socialize within DevOps / Platform teams



---

📍 Slide 10: Next Steps

1. Identify pilot use case (e.g., CI/CD incident handler)


2. Connect Jenkins/Splunk/Jira sandbox


3. Build agent + Streamlit UI


4. Demo results + collect feedback


5. Roll out in more environments
