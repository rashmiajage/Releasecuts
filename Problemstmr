High Operational Overhead Due to Manual Execution of Repetitive Browser-Based Tasks



The Platform team currently spends a significant amount of time performing manual, repetitive browser-based activities across 25+ Fargo components. These include:

Extracting vulnerability reports from security scanning portals like Checkmarx and Blackduck

Performing manual data entry and triggering builds for release cutoffs

Scraping content to retrieve build version information

Checking and reporting environment availability and health status


This manual execution is time-consuming, error-prone, and non-scalable, leading to delays, inefficiencies, and reduced team productivity.
